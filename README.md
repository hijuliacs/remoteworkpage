<h2 align="center">Info</h2>
<p align="center">I coded this page from a challenge proposed by Frontend Mentor website and as a test for a job opportunity. I used only HTML and CSS and finished everything in 2 days.</p>

<h2 align="center">What I Learned</h2>
<p align="center">There were some things I couldn't do due to my current level of programming knowledge, but I delivered what I could. The challenge included making a dropdown menu and adding responsiveness to the page, but despite trying, I couldn't do it.</p>
